# Book-Search

  ## Description
    With so many books to choose from and so many different ways to read or even listen to them I want a way to find and save any book I may be interested in.
    This allows users to serach for books and keep a list of any they are interested in in one convenient place
    This project has made finding and saving books simple
    I learned about using MongoAtlas, as well as the difficulties of working on finished code.
